## Cosmic and Planetary Formation
- **T = 0: The Convergence Event**  
  The universe is born in a cataclysmic expansion (similar to the Big Bang) with a hidden "arcane parameter" infused into its fabric.

- **Planck Epoch (T ≈ 10⁻⁴³ seconds)**  
  Fundamental physical laws and constants, including the latent magical field, crystallize.

- **Particle Formation (T ≈ 10⁻⁶ seconds)**  
  Quarks combine into protons and neutrons, with subtle arcane influences marking early matter.

- **Nucleosynthesis (T ≈ 3 minutes)**  
  Light elements (hydrogen, helium, lithium) form, with slight anomalies hinting at magical potential.

- **Recombination (T ≈ 380,000 years)**  
  Electrons bind with nuclei to create neutral atoms, releasing the Cosmic Microwave Background and early magical fluctuations.

- **Formation of Stars & Galaxies (T ≈ 100 million – 2 billion years)**  
  First stars ignite and galaxies assemble, with regions of enhanced arcane energy emerging.

- **Birth of the Local Star System (T ≈ 4–5 billion years)**  
  A unique star system forms with:
  - **Terra Humana:** A planet closer to the star, where the arcane field is diffused, setting the stage for a human-centric evolution.
  - **Aetheria Sylvana:** A planet farther out, where an amplified arcane field guides the evolution of magic-sensitive life.
